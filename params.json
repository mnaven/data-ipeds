  "body": "# Using the IPEDS Data\r\nWhile the IPEDS survey data contains a wealth of information, the data provided on the IPEDS website is not very user-friendly. This project provides files that create Stata .dta long form panel datasets of IPEDS surveys for use in academic research.\r\n\r\n## Downloading the IPEDS Files\r\nThe raw data must first be downloaded from the [IPEDS Data Center Complete Data Files](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx). My preferred method to download all of the files simultaneously is to use the Firefox extension [DownThemAll!](http://www.downthemall.net/) with the archives filter. The project assumes that all of the IPEDS files are downloaded to a folder named _downloads_ located in the folder where you would like to store the IPEDS data.\r\n\r\n## Python Files\r\nThese files use [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to facilitate the organization and creation of raw (uncleaned) Stata .dta files for each academic year from the IPEDS Data Center Complete Data Files. These individual year files can then be appended to create Stata .dta files that contain all years of data for each survey. Each script contains a variable named _ipeds_directory_ that must be changed to the folder path of where you would like to store the IPEDS data. As mentioned above, the scripts operate under the assumption that the _ipeds_directory_ contains a subfolder named _downloads_ to which all IPEDS files are originally downloaded.\r\n\r\nThe project scripts combine to delete duplicate/SPSS/SAS files, sort data dictionaries to the corresponding year within the codebooks folder, sort .do files that create .dta files to the corresponding year within the do_files folder, sort raw .csv files to the corresponding year within the raw_data folder, change the directory in each do file to the _ipeds_directory_ folder, remove the default insheet file path which corresponds to a path local to IPEDS, add a capture command to each label command in the .do files (some files have incorrect labels or illegal characters), unzip all the files, create .dta files from the raw .csv files, and then delete all unnecessary unzipped files. A list of files for which a .dta file could not be successfully created from the raw .csv file is also created.\r\n\r\nA README file describes the order in which each script should be run, although the _run_all.py_ script will automatically run the scripts in the correct order. The IPEDS files are originally downloaded as zipped files, however the project also includes functions and scripts that will edit unzipped files in case the files have already been unzipped or if edits only need to be made to an individual file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Do Files\r\nAfter creating individual year .dta files using the Python scripts, these files append the individual years for each survey together and then clean the resulting datasets.",
